First, it is important to recognize how ‘MPICH’ and 'Open-MPI’ are different, i.e. that they are designed to meet different needs. MPICH is supposed to be high-quality reference implementation of the latest MPI standard and the basis for derivative implementations to meet special purpose needs. Open-MPI targets the common case, both in terms of usage and network conduits. - [MPICH vs OpenMPI](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2427399/mpich-vs-openmpi)
